# Portfolio Webpage

## A portfolio for my websites

This webpage will be a portfolio of my work (once available). It includes a clickable grid of portfolios, contact and other relevant information, an attached resume (opening in another window) and a brief 'about' section.

This is created out of a need for a display for what will be my deployed websites, nd has given me an opportunity to learn to create a webpage using CSS grid.
